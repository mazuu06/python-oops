===> Classes ?
A class is a bluprint defined by a user to create multiple objects form it.

===> Objects ?
Instantiation of a class called object of that class. Class is a blueprint that does not contain data but objects have actual data.

===> __init__ method ?
It is a constructor is a special method in python that call automatically when object is created.

	1) default constructor
	2) parameterized constructor

===> Class and Instance Variables ?
Variables that declare outside from all methods but inside a class called called class variables. 
Variables associated with an instance and assigned inside a constructor called instance variables.

===> Destructors ?
A keyword "del" Destructors in python that is use to delete an instance.

===> Inheritance ?
Derive the methods and properties of one class into another class called inheritance.
Types of inheritance:
	1) Single inheritance
	2) Multiple inheritance
	3) Multilevel inheritance
	4) Hierarchical inheritance
	5) Hybrid inheritance

===> Encapsulation ?
The Process of restrict variables from being access to another class called encapsulation.
We use two types of variales.
	1) Protected Varibles
	2) Private variables
	
===> Polymorphism ?
poly means many morphism means forms. Polymorphism means one object have multiple forms instead of one.

===> Class or Static Variables ?
Static variables are those variables that are common for all methos in class and intialize outside from all methods but inside a class.

===> Class method vs Static method ?
Class method is use to create a isolated method inside a class. We @staticmethod decorator for class method. It have first perameter cls.
Static methos is use to modify class properties. We @classmethod decorator for static method.It hase no default perameter.
